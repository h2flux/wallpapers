Original (day/light) wallpapers were taken from [Microsoft's Wallpaper Collection](https://wallpapers.microsoft.design/). The night wallpapers were created by me.

I've only uploaded the optimized (7680x5120 ~4MB) images to GitHub as it really isn't meant to host wildly large files. If you want the maximum quality versions, I've shared them publically via Megaâ€”[here](https://mega.nz/folder/44tXUCJY#eI13n5ErPa3_bgvrHKk5qA).
